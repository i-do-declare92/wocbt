            <h3 class="head1">What is your goal?</h3>
            <p class="para1">
                These tours were created to help people to learn about the awe-inspiring things our Creator, Jehovah God, has made, without the taint of certain needless human philosophies. The more we study the sciences, the better we understand God and can draw closer to him, and everyone ought to have that opportunity.

            <h3 class="head2">What subjects do you cover?</h3>
            <p class="para1">
                Our current tours primarily focus on the sciences of paleontology, geology, biology, and evolution, as these are the most useful in discussing the Genesis creation account and God’s prehistoric masterpieces. (More subjects may be added in the future.)

            <h3 class="head3">Will you add more tours?</h3>
            <p class="para1">
                That is always a possibility. We do have more ideas for tours. When new tours or languages made available, we will announce it on Instagram,<a class="insta" href="https://www.instagram.com/wondersofcreationtours/"> @wondersofcreationtours</a>. If you would like to have a tour translated into your mother tongue, let us know via e-mail!

            <h3 class="head4">What are your references?</h3>
            <p class="para2">
                Each of our tours takes several months to prepare, involving in-depth research into all scriptural and secular material pertaining to the topic at hand. We use only the most up-to-date information provided by Jehovah’s Witnesses and the scientific community.

            <h3 class="head5">How is your company funded?</h3>
            <p class="para2">
                Make no mistake, the operation of this company is our full-time job. However, so that everyone can have the opportunity to learn more about the Book of Creation, we offer all of our services completely free of charge. We operate solely on voluntary donations. We suggest a donation of $5 per person (not per device) per tour, but this is not a requirement. If you wish to give, please see the following question.

        <div class="content2">
            <h3 class="head6">How can I donate?</h3>
            <p class="para2">
                Arrangements for donating are presented briefly at the end of each tour, as well as in your confirmation email. However, if you wish to help support our services at any time, please visit our Donate page and click on your personal tour guide’s profile for further instructions.

            <h3 class="head1">Can I book a private tour?</h3>
            <p class="para1">
                Yes! We do occasionally arrange to give private tours. If you wish to book a private event, please reach out to the appropriate tour guide (for specific language, adult/children tour, etc.) listed on the Contact Us page. Typically, we ask that private groups be no less than 100 connections (devices), and no more than 400. (These large numbers do not apply to the children’s tours.) Likely, a private tour will need to be booked a month in advance, or more.

        <div class="content3">
            <h3 class="head2">Why do I never see any tours available?</h3>
            <p class="para1">
                We only schedule tours for one month at a time. (So don’t bother looking for tours more than two months out.) We post new tours once a month. Typically they all book up within just a few 6-12 hours of posting. So, if you are only a few days late checking for updates, everything may already be booked. We understand this can be very frustrating, and we are looking for ways to making the booking process less stressful. In the meantime, we appreciate your patience and understanding.

        <div class="content3">
            <h3 class="head3">When are new tours posted?</h3>
            <p class="para1">
                We post new tour dates for only one month at a time, near the end of previous month. We announce on our Instagram account (@WondersOfCreationTours) as soon as more tours are made available. Please note: typically, all of our tours are booked within 12 hours of being posted. We do not currently have any mailing, waiting, or cancellation list.

             <h3 class="head4">How do I cancel a tour I booked?</h3>
             <p class="para2">
                 If you are unable to attend a tour you booked, there is no need to contact us directly. Just click the “Cancel/Change” button in either the email receipt or email reminder that you received. We appreciate you taking this extra step, because by clicking the “Cancel” button you will free up your spot on the website, which allows for others to book your spot instead.

                <p class="para2">
                    We now have a subscription page to sign up for our monthly email newsletter. The news letter contains the upcoming tours, dates, times, and announcements for the upcoming month.

                <h3 class="head6">Can non-witnesses attend these tours?</h3>
                <p class="para2">
                    Yes! Though these presentations were created by Jehovah’s Witnesses for Jehovah’s Witnesses, they are also open to the public. So if you have non-Witness family, friends, coworkers, schoolmates, return visits or Bible students that would be interested in viewing these tours, they are welcome to attend.
