# Wonders of Creation Virtual Bible Tours™ ©2020 - 2023

## The start of the documentation of WOCBT website
The very first part of the journey has already begun in the HTML files.
Stephen Serio has grouped the divs with content that Evan Sizemore and Vanessa Dubay created to be later used for CSS, JS, and possibly PHP. 

    The very purpose of this webiste is to educate the public about natural science and to strengthen their faith in our Creator Jehovah God.

## HTML Construction
S.S., constructed the HTML files to lay out how the web pages will be designed. The content that E.S. and V.D. created for the web pages were all placed in divs for a grid like structure. Laying our all of the HTML before hand gives S.S. a map of how and where all of the content and images will be place in the CSS stages of the website.

### Images
S.S., Added the images in the HTML files of every page. We chose to go this route for the fact that it will load the images faster to repsond to the CSS in a cleaner manner. Images that have been used is property of of Wonders Of Creation Virtual Bible Tours™

### CSS Construction
S.S., Started and finished the CSS for the navigation bar for all of the pages of the website. All of the CSS has been done by hand and with fore thought for future interaction with the code base. Comments are placed to keep track of what is controlling what. Most of it is pretty basic but nonetheless belongs to Wonders of Creation Virtual Bible Tours. S.S., has also imported all of the images that are to be used from E.S. from multiple mueseums in North America.

## Collaboration Starts With Ian Waddell / CSS & HTML PT. 2
I.W. reconstructed the navigation bar, footer, and was part of the initial CSS on both the home page and booking pages. I.W. also helped reconstruct the HTML of these pages as well as the navigation on EVERY current webpage.
